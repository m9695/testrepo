THE AMAZING HARE


  A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing:  "Though you be swift as the
wind, I will beat you in a race."  The Hare, believing her
assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and
they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the
goal.  On the day appointed for the race the two started
together.  The Tortoise got tired and stopped for while, and. went on
with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. 
The Hare, never stopped for a moment. Moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise
had not reached the goal, got to the finish line.  


    Maybe slow and steady doesn't win after all.


Well! Interesting end to the story
